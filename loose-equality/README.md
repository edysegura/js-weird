# JavaScript Loose Equality

"Loose equality can lead to more headaches than itâ€™s worth."

```javascript
console.log(a == 1 && a == 2 && a == 3)
//true
```

Run it on [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/qelucaz/1/edit?js,console)

"Triple Equals (strict equality) is superior to double equals. Whenever possible, you should use triple equals to test equality. By testing the type and value you can be sure that you are always executing a true equality test."
