# Float Operation

So you’ve written some absurdly simple code, say for example:

	0.1 + 0.2

and got a really unexpected result:

	0.30000000000000004

Run it in [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/veqekepine/edit?js,console)

Weird right? But it’s not stupid, just different. Decimal numbers cannot accurately represent a number like 1/3. I also happens in [Java](http://rextester.com/YJO29878) for example!
