# Float Operation

So you’ve written some absurdly simple code, say for example:

	0.1 + 0.2

and got a really unexpected result:

	0.30000000000000004

Weird right? But it’s not stupid, just different. Decimal numbers cannot accurately represent a number like 1/3. I also happens in Java for example!
